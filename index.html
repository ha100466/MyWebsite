  <h4>
  Cars. We all love cars. They are the safest way to transport between Point A to Point B.
    There are numerous types of cars that can be bought whether it's a sports car,<br>
    Luxury car, Classic car or average car. Recently, I have seen multiple cars like<br> 
    the BMW M3 from the 1990s which looks extremely cool! Now we have an abomination like the BMW i7.<br>
    That's an ugly BMW. BMW's are cars that never get ugly. LISTEN I AM NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT BMW'S IT'S<br>
    AN EXAMPLE. Anyways, BMW has for the time created an <strong>UGLY CAR!</strong><br> 
    Not even people that review cars like the exterior.</h4>

 <h3>Over this text is a video I found of someone else talking about the same topic.</h3>
  
  <h2>Why is this the case for most new cars?</h2>
  <h4>As modern technology in the interior improves, the exterior becomes more cooler to people with no taste<br>
    Judging by all the reviews of the concept cars, They would consider it cool BUT LOOK AT THE CONCEPT CARS<br>
    FROM THE 1980s. The old concept cars are quite accurate and that makes me really worried of the future of<br>
    automobiles. What will motorbikes look like when this world evolves?
  </h4>
  
  <h3>Good Companies</h3>
  <h4>All modern cars will look bad but some companies like Nissan and Toyota still keep some classic cars.</h4>

  <h3>Why is this bad for Car Manufacturers Reputation?</h3>
  <h4>This will be bad for their reputations because people who love these types of cars are expecting something<br>
  good looking but they find out that the new Toyota Supra looks bad.
  </h4>

  <h3>What we are not looking forward to?</h3>
  <h4>We are looking forward to actually Normal cars with normal headlights rather than having headlights<br>
  that are brighter than my Future and are Extremely small. A lot of car companies Like Lexus are in with the<br>
    large grill trend where they  make the grill of the car bigger than the interior looking at the image below
