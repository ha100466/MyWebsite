  Cars. We all love cars. They are the safest way to transport between Point A to Point B.
    There are numerous types of cars that can be bought whether it's a sports car,<br>
    Luxury car, Classic car or average car. Recently, I have seen multiple cars like<br> 
    the BMW M3 from the 1990s which looks extremely cool! Now we have an abomination like the BMW i7.<br>
    That's an ugly BMW. BMW's are cars that never get ugly. LISTEN I AM NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT BMW'S IT'S<br>
    AN EXAMPLE. Anyways, BMW has for the time created an <strong>UGLY CAR!</strong><br> 
    Not even people that review cars like the exterior.</p>

 <h3>Over this text is a video I found of someone else talking about the same topic.</h3>
  
  <h2>Why is this the case for most new cars?</h2>
  <p>As modern technology in the interior improves, the exterior becomes more cooler to people with no taste
  of cars
