  Cars. We all love cars. They are the safest way to transport between Point A to Point B.
    There are numerous types of cars that can be bought whether it's a sports car,
    Luxury car, Classic car or average car. Recently, I have seen multiple cars like 
    the BMW M3 from the 1990s which looks extremely cool! Now we have an abomination
    like the BMW i7 2023. That's an ugly BMW. BMW's are cars that never get ugly. LISTEN I AM NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
